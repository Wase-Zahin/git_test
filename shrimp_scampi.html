    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter, garlic,
        and white wine sauce. You can serve shrimp scampi
        by itself as an appetizer or over pasta as a main dish.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>2 shallots, finely diced </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined </li>
        <li>1 pinch kosher salt and freshly ground pepper /li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine </li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating
            your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, or
            measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If you use fresh
            shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day, then 
            keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the 
            shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before 
            serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp 
            immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to 
            sit for too long.</li>
        <li>It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook 
            for too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are 
            close to done when they start to curl into a C shape and turn from 
            translucent gray to opaque pink and white.</li>   
        <li>Before you drain the pasta, hold aside a half cup of the pasta water 
            to add to the sauce if the finished dish looks a little dry 
            (you may not have to add the entire half cup). Pasta water is a pasta 
            cook's secret weapon. The starchy water adds extra flavor and moistness 
            to the recipe, gives sauces a smoother texture, and helps bind the 
            sauce to the pasta. </li> 
    </ol>
